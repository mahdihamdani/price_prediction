#Discussion:
- Bag of n-grams featues were extracted from string columns with free text: different n-gram sizes tested
- Features with list of strings were preprocessed to have indicators
- Diffeent categorical features were tested on the columns
- Different regression models were tested as well --> random forests regression is kept in the end

# TODO
- Feature selection, simpler models with same performance?
