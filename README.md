# price_prediction
This is a python app which predicts the product price given a description and meta information about the product

## Prerequisites
- Python >= 2.7
- sklearn
- scipy
- pandas
- numpy
- category_encoders (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/categorical-encoding)
- haversine (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/haversine)

PS: category_encoders and haversine are installable with pip as well

## Running Training
```
python train_price.py --dataset data/dataset.csv
```

## Running Prediction
```
python predict_price.py --product_name "Pizza Margherita" --product_description 'Tomatensauce' --menu_category 'Fit Pizza' --city_id 9 --latitude 52.521918 --longitude 13.413215 --cuisine_characteristics "Amerikanisch, Gesundes Essen" --dish_type_characteristics "GemÃ¼se"
```

## Discussion:
- Bag of n-grams featues were extracted from string columns with free text: different n-gram sizes tested
- Features with list of strings were preprocessed to have indicators
- Diffeent categorical features were tested on the columns
- Geographical information (lattitude/longitude) is used as well. A clustering method for geographical coordinates based on the haversine distance is used before the construction of the final categorical features 
- Different regression models were tested as well --> random forests regression is kept in the end

## TODO
- Feature selection, simpler models with same performance?
